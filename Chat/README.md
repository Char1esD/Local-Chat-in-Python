This tool allows you to create a local chat server or connect to it if one already exists. It has been developed in French but translation is in progress. It only works on the same network. (I think)


## Installation

To install it, you just have to clone the repository

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Char1esD/Local-Chat-in-Python
  cd Local-Chat-in-Python
```
    
## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the program

```bash
python Chat.py
```
To connect to an existing server, you will need the IP and port chosen by the creator.
